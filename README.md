# Search with Prioritizing Matches
- The program is created using Python.
 
- It uses an algorithm similar to the backend of Google search.

- The program accepts a user-defined number of lines and appends them to a list.

- It displays all the accepted lines while removing any duplicate lines.

- Users are prompted to enter a keyword for searching within the lines.


# For the keyword search:

- The program counts the frequency of the entered keyword in each line.

- If the keyword's frequency is zero, it displays "no results found".

- If only one result is found, it displays that single result.

- If multiple results are found, the program shows the result with the highest keyword frequency.

- The program asks the user if they are satisfied with the result.

- If the user is satisfied, the program ends and displays "operation completed successfully."

- If the user is not satisfied, the program displays the second most appropriate result and repeats the satisfaction inquiry.

- This process continues until the user is satisfied with a result or decides not to proceed further.
